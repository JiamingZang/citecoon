Abstract
Multi-person pose estimation in the wild is challenging.
Although state-of-the-art human detectors have demon-
strated good performance, small errors in localization and
recognition are inevitable. These errors can cause failures
for a single-person pose estimator (SPPE), especially for
methods that solely depend on human detection results. In
this paper, we propose a novel regional multi-person pose
estimation (RMPE) framework to facilitate pose estimation
in the presence of inaccurate human bounding boxes. Our
framework consists of three components: Symmetric Spa-
tial Transformer Network (SSTN), Parametric Pose Non-
Maximum-Suppression (NMS), and Pose-Guided Proposals
Generator (PGPG). Our method is able to handle inaccu-
rate bounding boxes and redundant detections, allowing it
to achieve 76.7 mAP on the MPII (multi person) dataset[3].
Our model and source codes are made publicly available.†.
1. Introduction
Human pose estimation is a fundamental challenge for
computer vision.
In practice, recognizing the pose of
multiple persons in the wild is a lot more challenging
than recognizing the pose of a single person in an im-
age [30, 31, 21, 23, 38].
Recent attempts approach this
problem by using either a two-step framework [28, 12] or a
part-based framework [7, 27, 17]. The two-step framework
ﬁrst detects human bounding boxes and then estimates the
pose within each box independently. The part-based frame-
work ﬁrst detects body parts independently and then assem-
bles the detected body parts to form multiple human poses.
Both frameworks have their advantages and disadvantages.
In the two-step framework, the accuracy of pose estimation
highly depends on the quality of the detected bounding box-

timated human poses. Because each bounding box is operated on
independently, multiple poses are detected for a single person.
es. In the part-based framework, the assembled human pos-
es are ambiguous when two or more persons are too close
together. Also, part-based framework loses the capability
to recognize body parts from a global pose view due to the
mere utilization of second-order body parts dependence.
Our approach follows the two-step framework. We aim
to detect accurate human poses even when given inaccu-
rate bounding boxes. To illustrate the problems of previous
approaches, we applied the state-of-the-art object detector
Faster-RCNN [29] and the SPPE Stacked Hourglass mod-
el [23]. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show two major problems:
the localization error problem and the redundant detection
problem. In fact, SPPE is rather vulnerable to bounding
box errors. Even for the cases when the bounding boxes
are considered as correct with IoU > 0.5, the detected hu-
man poses can still be wrong. Since SPPE produces a pose
for each given bounding box, redundant detections result in
redundant poses.
To address the above problems, a regional multi-person
pose estimation (RMPE) framework is proposed.
Our
framework improves the performance of SPPE-based hu-
man pose estimation algorithms. We have designed a new
symmetric spatial transformer network (SSTN) which is at-
tached to the SPPE to extract a high-quality single person
region from an inaccurate bounding box. A novel paral-
lel SPPE branch is introduced to optimize this network. To
address the problem of redundant detection, a parametric

detected bounding boxes with IoU > 0.5. The heatmaps are the outputs of SPPE [23] corresponding to the two types of boxes. The
corresponding body parts are not detected in the heatmaps of the yellow boxes. Note that with IoU > 0.5, the yellow boxes are considered
as “correct” detections. However, human poses are not detected even with the “correct” bounding boxes.
pose NMS is introduced. Our parametric pose NMS elimi-
nates redundant poses by using a novel pose distance met-
ric to compare pose similarity. A data-driven approach is
applied to optimize the pose distance parameters. Lastly,
we propose a novel pose-guided human proposal genera-
tor (PGPG) to augment training samples. By learning the
output distribution of a human detector for different poses,
we can simulate the generation of human bounding boxes,
producing a large sample of training data.
Our RMPE framework is general and is applicable to
different human detectors and single person pose estima-
tors. We applied our framework on the MPII (multi-person)
dataset [3], where it outperforms the state-of-the-art meth-
ods and achieves 76.7 mAP. We have also conducted ab-
lation studies to validate the effectiveness of each pro-
posed component of our framework. Our model and source
codes are made publicly available to support reproducible
research.

2.1. Single Person Pose Estimation
In single person pose estimation, the pose estimation
problem is simpliﬁed by only attempting to estimate the
pose of a single person, and the person is assumed to dom-
inate the image content.
Conventional methods consid-
ered pictorial structure models. For example, tree model-
s [37, 30, 40, 36] and random forest models [31, 8] have
demonstrated to be very efﬁcient in human pose estimation.
Graph based models such as random ﬁeld models [20] and
dependency graph models [14] have also been widely inves-
tigated in the literature [13, 32, 21, 26].
More recently, deep learning has become a promising
technique in object/face recognition, and human pose es-
timation is of no exception. Representative works include
DeepPose (Toshev et al) [34], DNN based models [24, 11]
and various CNN based models [19, 33, 23, 4, 38]. Apart
from simply estimating a human pose, some studies [9, 25]
consider human parsing and pose estimation simultaneous-
ly. For single person pose estimation, these methods could
perform well only when the person has been correctly lo-
cated. However, this assumption is not always satisﬁed.
2.2. Multi Person Pose Estimation
Part-based Framework Representative works on part-
based framework [7, 12, 35, 27, 17] are reviewed. Chen et
al. presented an approach to parse largely occluded people
by graphical model which models humans as ﬂexible com-
positions of body parts [7]. Gkiox et al used k-poselets to
jointly detect people and predict locations of human poses
[12]. The ﬁnal pose localization is predicted by a weighted
average of all activated poselets. Pishchulin et al. proposed
DeepCut to ﬁrst detect all body parts, and then label and
assemble these parts via integral linear programming[27].
A stronger part detector based on ResNet[15] and a better
incremental optimization strategy is proposed by Insafut-
dinov et al [17]. While part-based methods have demon-
strated good performance, their body-part detectors can be
vulnerable since only small local regions are considered.
Two-step Framework Our work follows the two-step
framework [28, 12]. In our work, we use a CNN based
SPPE method to estimate poses, while Pishchulin et al. [28]
used conventional pictorial structure models for pose esti-
mation. In particular, Insafutdinov et al [17] propose a sim-
ilar two-step pipeline which uses the Faster R-CNN as their
human detector and a unary DeeperCut as their pose estima-
tor. Their method can only achieve 51.0 in mAP on MPII
dataset, while ours can achieve 76.7 mAP. With the develop-
ment of object detection and single person pose estimation,
the two-step framework can achieve further advances in its
performance. Our paper aims to solve the problem of im-
perfect human detection in the two-step framework in order
to maximize the power of SPPE.

Figure 3. Pipeline of our RMPE framework. Our Symmetric STN consists of STN and SDTN which are attached before and after the
SPPE. The STN receives human proposals and the SDTN generates pose proposals. The Parallel SPPE acts as an extra regularizer during
the training phase. Finally, the parametric Pose NMS (p-Pose NMS) is carried out to eliminate redundant pose estimations. Unlike
traditional training, we train the SSTN+SPPE module with images generated by PGPG.
3. Regional Multi-person Pose Estimation
The pipeline of our proposed RMPE is illustrated in Fig-
ure 3.
The human bounding boxes obtained by the hu-
man detector are fed into the “Symmetric STN + SPPE”
module, and the pose proposals are generated automatical-
ly. The generated pose proposals are reﬁned by parametric
Pose NMS to obtain the estimated human poses. During the
training, we introduce “Parallel SPPE” in order to avoid
local minimums and further leverage the power of SSTN.
To augment the existing training samples, a pose-guided
proposals generator (PGPG) is designed. In the follow-
ing sections, we present the three major components of our
framework.
3.1. Symmetric STN and Parallel SPPE
Human proposals provided by human detectors are not
well-suited to SPPE. This is because SPPE is speciﬁcally
trained on single person images and is very sensitive to lo-
calisation errors. It has been shown that small translation or
cropping of human proposals can signiﬁcantly affect perfor-
mance of SPPE [23]. Our symmetric STN + parallel SPPE
was introduced to enhance SPPE when given imperfect hu-
man proposals. The module of our SSTN and parallel SPPE
is shown in Figure 4.

The
spatial

network
[18](STN) has demonstrated excellent performance in s-
electing region of interests automatically.
In this paper,
we use the STN to extract high quality dominant human
proposals. Mathematically, the STN performs a 2D afﬁne
transformation which can be expressed as

where θ1, θ2 and θ3 are vectors in R2.
{xs
i, ys
i } and
{xt
i, yt
i} are the coordinates before and after transformation,
respectively. After SPPE, the resulting pose is mapped in-
to the original human proposal image. Naturally, a spatial
de-transformer network (SDTN) is required to remap the
estimated human pose back to the original image coordi-
nate. The SDTN computes the γ for de-transformation and
generates grids based on γ:

After extracting high quality dominant human proposal
regions, we can utilize off-the-shelf SPPE for accurate pose
estimation. In our training, the SSTN is ﬁne-tuned together
with our SPPE.
Parallel SPPE
To further help STN extract good human-
dominant regions, we add a parallel SPPE branch in the
training phrase.
This branch shares the same STN with

Figure 4. An illustration of our symmetric STN architecture and our training strategy with parallel SPPE. The STN used was developed
by Jaderberg et al. [18]. Our SDTN takes a parameter θ, generated by the localization net and computes the γ for de-transformation. We
follow the grid generator and sampler [18] to extract a human-dominant region. For our parallel SPPE branch, a center-located pose label
is speciﬁed. We freeze the weights of all layers of the parallel SPPE to encourage the STN to extract a dominant single person proposal.
the original SPPE, but the spatial de-transformer (SDTN)
is omitted. The human pose label of this branch is spec-
iﬁed to be centered.
To be more speciﬁc, the output of
this SPPE branch is directly compared to labels of center-
located ground truth poses. We freeze all the layers of this
parallel SPPE during the training phase. The weights of
this branch are ﬁxed and its purpose is to back-propagate
center-located pose errors to the STN module. If the ex-
tracted pose of the STN is not center-located, the parallel
branch will back-propagate large errors. In this way, we
can help the STN focus on the correct area and extract high
quality human-dominant regions. In the testing phase, the
parallel SPPE is discarded. The effectiveness of our parallel
SPPE will be veriﬁed in our experiments.
Discussions The parallel SPPE can be regarded as a regu-
larizer during the training phase. It helps to avoid a poor so-
lution (local minimum) where the STN does not transform
the pose to the center of extracted human regions. The like-
lihood of reaching a local minimum is increased because
compensation from the SDTN will make the network gen-
erate fewer errors. These errors are necessary to train the
STN. With the parallel SPPE, the STN is trained to move
the human to the center of the extracted region to facilitate
accurate pose estimation by SPPE.
It may seem intuitive to replace parallel SPPE with a
center-located poses regression loss in the output of SPPE
(before SDTN). However, this approach will degrade the
performance of our system. Although STN can partly trans-
form the input, it is impossible to perfectly place the per-
son at the same location as the label. The difference in co-
ordinate space between the input and label of SPPE will
largely impair its ability to learn pose estimation. This will
cause the performance of our main branch SPPE to de-
crease. Thus, to ensure that both STN and SPPE can ful-
ly leverage their own power, a parallel SPPE with frozen
weights is indispensable for our framework. The parallel
SPPE always produces large errors for non-center poses to
push the STN to produce a center-located pose, without af-
fecting the performance of the main branch SPPE.
3.2. Parametric Pose NMS
Human detectors inevitably generate redundant detec-
tions, which in turn produce redundant pose estimations.
Therefore, pose non-maximum suppression (NMS) is re-
quired to eliminate the redundancies.
Previous methods
[5, 7] are either not efﬁcient or not accurate enough. In this
paper, we propose a parametric pose NMS method. Similar
to the previous subsection, the pose Pi, with m joints is de-
noted as {⟨k1
i , c1
i ⟩, . . . , ⟨km
i , cm
i ⟩}, where kj
i and cj
i are the
jth location and conﬁdence score of joints respectively.
NMS scheme We revisit pose NMS as follows: ﬁrstly, the
most conﬁdent pose is selected as reference, and some poses
close to it are subject to elimination by applying elimination
criterion. This process is repeated on the remaining poses
set until redundant poses are eliminated and only unique
poses are reported.
Elimination Criterion We need to deﬁne pose similarity
in order to eliminate the poses which are too close and too
similar to each others. We deﬁne a pose distance metric
d(Pi, Pj|Λ) to measure the pose similarity, and a threshold
η as elimination criterion, where Λ is a parameter set of
function d(·). Our elimination criterion can be written as
follows:
f( Pi, Pj|Λ, η) = 1[d(Pi, Pj|Λ, λ) ≤η]
(7)
If d(·) is smaller than η, the output of f(·) should be 1,
2337

which indicates that pose Pi should be eliminated due to
redundancy with reference pose Pj.
Pose Distance
Now, we present the distance function
dpose(Pi, Pj). We assume that the box for Pi is Bi. Then
we deﬁne a soft matching function
KSim(Pi, Pj|σ1) =
(P
n tanh cn
i
σ1 · tanh
cn
j
σ1 ,
if kn
j is within B(kn
i )
0
otherwise
(8)
where B(kn
i ) is a box center at kn
i , and each dimension of
B(kn
i ) is 1/10 of the original box Bi. The tanh operation
ﬁlters out poses with low-conﬁdence scores. When two cor-
responding joints both have high conﬁdence scores, the out-
put will be close to 1. This distance softly counts the num-
ber of joints matching between poses.
The spatial distance between parts is also considered,
which can be written as
HSim(Pi, Pj|σ2) =
X
n
exp[−(kn
i −kn
j )2
σ2
]
(9)
By combining Eqn (8) and (9), the ﬁnal distance function
can be written as
d(Pi, Pj|Λ) = KSim(Pi, Pj|σ1) + λHSim(Pi, Pj|σ2)
(10)
where λ is a weight balancing the two distances and Λ =
{σ1, σ2, λ}. Note that the previous pose NMS [7] set pose
distance parameters and thresholds manually. In contrast,
our parameters can be determined in a data-driven manner.
Optimization Given the detected redundant poses, the four
parameters in the eliminate criterion f( Pi, Pj|Λ, η) are op-
timized to achieve the maximal mAP for the validation set.
Since exhaustive search in a 4D space is intractable, we
optimize two parameters at a time by ﬁxing the other t-
wo parameters in an iterative manner. Once convergence
is achieved, the parameters are ﬁxed and will be used in the
testing phase.
3.3. Pose-guided Proposals Generator
Data Augmentation
For the two-stage pose estimation,
proper data augmentation is necessary to make the SST-
N+SPPE module adapt to the ’imperfect’ human proposals
generated by the human detector. Otherwise, the module
may not work properly in the testing phase for the human
detector. An intuitive approach is to directly use bounding
boxes generated by the human detector during the training
phase. However, the human detector can only produce one
bounding box for each person. By using the proposals gen-
erator, this quantity can be greatly increased. Since we al-
ready have the ground truth pose and an object detection

eral different atomic poses. More results are available in supple-
mentary materials. Best viewed in color.
bounding box for each person, we can generate a large sam-
ple of training proposals with the same distribution as the
output of the human detector. With this technique, we are
able to further boost the performance of our system.
Insight We ﬁnd that the distribution of the relative offset
between the detected bounding box and the ground truth
bounding box varies across different poses. To be more spe-
ciﬁc, there exists a distribution P(δB|P), where δB is the
offset between the coordinates of a bounding box generated
by human detector and the coordinates of the ground truth
bounding box, and P is the ground truth pose of a person.
If we can model this distribution, we are able to generate
many training samples that are similar to human proposals
generated by the human detector.
Implementation
To
directly
learn
the
distribution
P(δB|P) is difﬁcult due to the variation of human
poses.
So instead, we attempt to learn the distribution
P(δB|atom(P)), where atom(P) denotes the atomic
pose [39] of P. We follow the method used by Andriluka
et al [3] to learn the atomic poses. To derive the atomic
poses from annotations of human poses, we ﬁrst align all
poses so that their torsos have the same length. Then we
use the k-means algorithm to cluster our aligned poses,
and the computed cluster centers form our atomic poses.
Now for each person instance sharing the same atomic
pose a, we calculate the offsets between its ground truth
bounding box and detected bounding box.
The offsets
are then normalized by the corresponding side-length of
ground truth bounding box in that direction. After these
processes, the offsets form a frequency distribution, and
we ﬁt our data to a Gaussian mixture distribution.
For
2338

different atomic poses, we have different Gaussian mixture
parameters.
We visualize some of the distributions and
their corresponding clustered human poses in Figure 5.
Proposals Generation During the training phase of the
SSTN+SPPE, for each annotated pose in the training sam-
ple we ﬁrst look up the corresponding atomic pose a. Then
we generate additional offsets by dense sampling according
to P(δB|a) to produce augmented training proposals.
4. Experiments
The proposed method is qualitatively and quantitatively
evaluated on two standard multi-person datasets with large
occlusion cases: MPII [3] and MSCOCO 2016 Keypoints
Challenge dataset[1].
4.1. Evaluation datasets
MPII Multi-Person Dataset The challenging benchmark
MPII Human Pose (multi-person)[3] consists of 3,844 train-
ing and 1,758 testing groups with both occluded and over-
lapped people.
Moreover, it contains more than 28,000
training samples for single person pose estimation. We use
all the training data in the single person dataset and 90% of
the multi-person training set to ﬁne-tune the SPPE, leaving
10% for validation.
MSCOCO Keypoints Challenge We also evaluate our
method on the MSCOCO Keypoints Challenge dataset[1].
This dataset requires localization of person keypoints in
challenging, uncontrolled conditions. It consists of 105,698
training and around 80,000 testing human instances. The
training set contains over 1 million total labeled key-
points. The testing set are divided into four roughly equally
sized splits: test-challenge, test-dev, test-standard, and test-
reserve.
4.2. Implementation details in testing
In this paper, we use the VGG-based SSD-512 [22] as
our human detector, as it performs object detection effec-
tively and efﬁciently. In order to guarantee that the entire
person region will be extracted, detected human proposals
are extended by 30% along both the height and width direc-
tions. We use the stacked hourglass model [23] as the single
person pose estimator because of its superior performance.
For the STN network, we adopt the ResNet-18 [15] as our
localization network. Considering the memory efﬁciency,
we use a smaller 4-stack hourglass network as the parallel
SPPE.
4.3. Results
Results on MPII dataset.
We evaluated our method on
full MPII multi-person test set. Quantitative results on the
full testing set are given in Table 1. Notably, we achieve an
average accuracy of 72 mAP on identifying difﬁcult joints
such as wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees, which is 3.3 mAP
higher than the previous state-of-the-art result. We reach a
ﬁnal accuracy of 70.4 mAP for the wrist and an accuracy
of 73 mAP for the knee. We present some of our results
in Figure 6. These results show that our method can accu-
rately predict pose in multi-person images. More results are
presented in supplementary materials.
Results on MSCOCO Keypoints dataset. We ﬁne-tuned
the SPPE on the MSCOCO Keypoints training + validat-
ing sets and leave 5,000 images for validation. Quantita-
tive results on the test-dev set are given in Table 2. Our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Note that
when using a similar human detector and SPPE, our method
outperforms R4D and Caltech by a great margin.
Even
when using an inferior human detector (SSD, 28.8 mAP VS
G-RMI, 41.6 mAP on MSCOCO Detections test-dev set),
without extra in-house training data and ensembling, our t-
wo step method outperforms the performance of G-RMI by
1.3 mAP, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our pro-
posed framework.

4.4. Ablation studies
We evaluate the effectiveness of the three proposed com-
ponents, i.e., symmetric STN, pose-guided proposals gen-
erator and parametric pose NMS. The ablative studies have
been conducted by removing the proposed components
from the pipeline or replacing the proposed components
with conventional solvers.
The straightforward two-step
method without the three components and the upper-bound
of our framework are tested for comparison. We conducted
these experiments on the MPII validation set. In addition,
we replace our human detection module to prove the gener-
ality of our framework.
Symmetric STN and Parallel SPPE To validate the im-
portance of symmetric STN and parallel SPPE, two experi-
ments were conducted. In the ﬁrst experiment, we removed
the SSTN, including the parallel SPPE, from our pipeline.

Figure 6. Some results of our model’s predictions.
In the second experiment, we only removed the parallel
SPPE and kept the symmetric STN structure. Both of these
results are shown in Table 3(a). We can observe perfor-
mance degradation when removing parallel SPPE, which
implies that parallel SPPE with single person image labels
strongly encourages the STN to extract single person re-
gions to minimize the total losses.
Pose-guided Proposals Generator In Table 3(b), we
demonstrate that our pose-guided proposals generator also
plays an important role in our system. In this experimen-
t, we ﬁrst remove the data augmentation from our training
phase. The ﬁnal mAP drops to 73.0%. Then we compare
our data augmentation technique with a simple baseline.
The baseline is formed by jittering the locations and aspect
ratios of the bounding boxes produced by person detector to
generate a large number of additional proposals. We choose
those that have IoU>0.5 with ground truth boxes. From our
result in Table 3(b), we can see that our technique is better
than the baseline method. Generating training proposals ac-
cording to the distribution can be regarded as a kind of data
re-sampling, which can help the model to better ﬁt human
proposals.
Parametric Pose NMS Since pose NMS is an independen-
t module, we can directly remove it from our ﬁnal mod-
el. The experimental results are shown in Table 3(c). As
we can see, the mAP drops signiﬁcantly if the paramet-
ric pose NMS is removed. This is because the increase in
the number of redundant poses will ultimately decrease our
precision. We note that the previous pose NMS can also
eliminate redundant detection to some extent. The state-of-

Table 3. Results of the ablation experiments on our validation set. “w/o X” means without X module in our pipeline. “random jittering*”
means generating training proposals by jittering locations and aspect ratios of the detected human bounding boxes. “PoseNMS [x]” reports
the result when using the pose NMS algorithm developed in paper [x].
the-art pose NMS algorithms [5, 7] are used to replace our
parametric pose NMS, with the results given in Table 3(c).
These schemes perform less effectively than ours, since the
parameter learning is missing. In terms of efﬁciency, on
our validation set which contains 1300 images, the publicly
available implementation of [5]‡takes 62.2 seconds to per-
form pose NMS while using our algorithm takes only 1.8
seconds.
Upper Bound of Our Framework The upper bound of our
framework is tested, where we use the ground truth bound-
ing boxes as human proposals. As shown in Table 3(e), this
setting could yield 84.2% mAP. It veriﬁes that our system
is already close to the upper-bound of two-step framework.
Human Detector Modules By replacing the human detec-
tor with ResNet50 based Faster-RCNN[29] (32.0 mAP on
MSCOCO Detections test-dev set), the ﬁnal result on our
MPII valid set achieves 81.4 mAP and the result on MSCO-
CO Keypoints test-dev set achieves 63.3 mAP. It shows that
with stronger human detector, our framework can have bet-
ter performance, which proves that our RMPE framework
is general and is applicable to different human detectors.
4.5. Failure cases
We present some failure cases in Figure 7. It can be seen
that the SPPE can not handle poses which are rarely oc-
curred (e.g. the person performing the ’Human Flag’ in the
ﬁrst image). When two persons are highly overlapped, our
‡http://www.vision.caltech.edu/ dhall/projects/MergingPoseEstimates/
system get confused and can not separate them apart (e.g.
the two persons in the left of the second image). The miss-
es of person detector will also cause the missing detection
of human poses (e.g. the person who has laid down in the
third image). Finally, erroneous pose may still be detected
when an object looks very similar to human which can fool
both human detector and SPPE (e.g. the background object
in the forth image).
5. Conclusion
In this paper, a novel regional multi-person pose estima-
tion (RMPE) framework is proposed, which signiﬁcantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for multi-person
human pose estimation in terms of accuracy and efﬁciency.
It validates the potential of two-step frameworks, i.e., hu-
man detector + SPPE, when SPPE is adapted to a human de-
tector. Our RMPE framework consists of three novel com-
ponents: symmetric STN with parallel SPPE, parametric
pose NMS, and pose-guided proposals generator (PGPG).
In particular, PGPG is used to greatly argument the train-
ing data by learning the conditional distribution of bounding
box proposals for a given human pose. The SPPE becomes
adept at handling human localization errors due to the uti-
lization of symmetric STN and parallel SPPE. Finally, the
parametric pose NMS can be used to reduce redundant de-
tections. In our future work, it would be interesting to ex-
plore the possibility of training our framework together with
the human detector in an end-to-end manner.
